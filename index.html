        Bitmap is a social media app that lets users explore works of digital art
        throught augmented reality in physical environment around them. 
        With Bitmap open on their phone, users will see a feed of geo-specific 
        posts that fellow creatives have made and posted.</p>

    <h3>Objectives & Research</h3>

            <p id="p3">
            Our initial objectives in user research were to understand users views on art 
            an creativity, augmented reality and what aspects of social media platforms 
            they like and dislike.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="p3">75 users were surveyed and five interviews were conducted in 
                person and over zoom. We asked our users questions to understand their 
                basic demographics, their relationship to augmented reality, social media 
                and what creativity looked like in their day to day lives.</p>

    <h3>User Persona</h3>
    <p id="p1">
        Our target users are creative individuals who are seeking to make and share works 
        of art in a new way like our friend Liam below. Our users are people who are currently 
        active on other social media platforms such as Instagram but are losing interest in 
        the due to it becoming one giant ad.</p>

    <h3>Sketches & Iteration</h3>
    <img src="images/Iterations.png" alt="Mobile mockup iterations.">
    <p id="p4">With all of our research organized and visualized we began prototyping with sketched 
        mock-ups. We focused on key features in the app like a “Creator View” where users 
        would be using brushes, text, and emoji’s to bring their creative ideas to life in AR.</p>
    <p id="p4">We knew from the beginning that the Bitmap app would be a fairly new and novel 
        experience so our initial user flow would be an initial tutorial for users who had just
        downloaded the app. With that in mind our initial low-fi wireframes showed the process of 
        getting started using the app. From making posts, viewing profiles, and finding artwork near 
        the geographic locations our users are in.</p>
    <p id="p4">After testing the final prototype the only questions we received were about details 
        regarding the concept of the application. All of our tester’s feedback indicated our 
        prototype was easy to navigate and they clearly understood the tools to view or create art 
        in the app. Icons were described as familiar and straightforward and no one had to think 
        about how to move around.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <div id="conclusionContent">
        <img src="images/iPhone X.png" alt="Bitmap mockup homepage.">
        <p id="p5">A geo-specific social media app that is based in augmented reality is an incredibly 
            complex concept. When we landed on this idea, it seemed like there were hundreds of rabbit 
            holes we could have gone down. After a lot of discussion and competitor research, we felt 
            we found a niche that would serve creative users in a unique way. Through our iterative 
            process, we decided it was best to make the interface and icons as familiar as possible so 
            our users’ focus remained on creativity and not the learning curve of another app.</p>
        <p id="p5">For the next steps in our project, we’d like to take some time to further build 
            out the social aspect of the app, including a unique messaging function where users could 
            message each other only through exchanging drawings. This app was a lot of fun to think 
            about, design and share with users. We’re excited to take it even further.</p>
